description: Before it became a covert surveillance tool disguised as an outstanding
  browser extension, Stylish really was an outstanding browser extension. It bestowed
  upon its users nothing less than the power to change the appearance of the internet.
  Its extensive bank of user-made skins gave bright websites a dark background, undid
  disliked UI changes, and added manga pictures to everything that wasn’t a manga
  picture already. I spent many wonderful hours in its simple CSS editor, hiding the
  distracting parts of the web whilst unknowingly being spied on. Facebook news feed
  - gone. Twitter news feed - gone. Personal browsing history - gone. Quality of life
  and unexplained ennui - up and down respectively.
