description: Google has rolled out « Privacy Sandbox », a Chrome feature first announced
  back in 2019 that, among other things, exchanges third-party cookies—the most common
  form of tracking technology—for what the company is now calling « Topics ». Topics
  is a response to pushback against Google’s proposed Federated Learning of Cohorts
  (FLoC), which we called « a terrible idea » because it gave Google even more control
  over advertising in its browser while not truly protecting user privacy. While there
  have been some changes to how this works since 2019, Topics is still tracking your
  internet use for Google’s behavioral advertising.
