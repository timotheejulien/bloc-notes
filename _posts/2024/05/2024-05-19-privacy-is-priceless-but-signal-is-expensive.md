description: Signal is the world’s most widely used truly private messaging app, and
  our cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal
  app itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption
  technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting
  the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many
  others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit
  of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work to
  add a layer of quantum resistance to the Signal Protocol, and our previous work
  on metadata protection technologies that help keep personal details like your contact
  list, group membership, profile name, and other intimate information secure. This
  singular focus on preserving the ability to communicate privately is one reason
  that we work in the open, documenting our thinking and making our code open source
  and open to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it.
