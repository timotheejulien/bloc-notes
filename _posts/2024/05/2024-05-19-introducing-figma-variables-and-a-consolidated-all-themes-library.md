description: The Carbon Design team, in partnership with the IBM Figma guild, has
  enhanced our core theme Figma libraries to incorporate the latest feature enhancements
  introduced by Figma during Config 2023. We’re most excited about the new variables
  feature, which allow us to now apply design tokens in a more optimized and enriched
  way than ever before.
