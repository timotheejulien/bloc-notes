description: "Encryption doesn’t mean encryption. Encryption is a code word that stands for freedom of speech, the free press, and the preservation of the human rights we all hold dear. Encryption is a weapon that’s pointed directly at the biggest, most concentrated powers in the world; encryption makes those in power accountable and helps protect vulnerable people from exploitation. Recently, we’ve seen the powers that be take a few wild swings at encryption and attempt to depict it as a mystical and nefarious evil wizard technology used exclusively faceless hooded figures. Anyone who knows anything about encryption knows this isn’t true: encryption is actually used every single day by basically everyone and anyone who owns a computer."
