description: Did you know? Astigmatism is a visual condition where there is a refractive
  error that impedes the eye from focusing light evenly on the retina. This results
  in objects appearing to be blurry. According to the World Health Organization, refractive
  errors (nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism and presbyopia) account for
  43% of visual impairments occurring globally.
