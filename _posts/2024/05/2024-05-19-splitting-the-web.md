description: 'Thereâ€™s an increasing chasm dividing the modern web. On one side, the
  commercial, monopolies-riddled, media-adored web. A web which has only one objective:
  making us click. It measures clicks, optimises clicks, generates clicks. It gathers
  as much information as it could about us and spams every second of our life with
  ads, beep, notifications, vibrations, blinking LEDs, background music and fluorescent
  titles.'
