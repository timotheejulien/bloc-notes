description: 'A week ago, I finally got round to implementing an idea I’d been toying
  with for years: what if your computer made a little bit of noise every time it sent
  data to Google? From studying logs, I’d long known just how many sites send all
  your visits and clicks to (at least) Google, but a log that you have to manually
  create first and then analyze is not very dramatic. You need to work on it and finally
  you think “well yeah that is a lot”.'
