description: In many countries around the world, phone numbers are attached to biometrics
  data and personal IDs. Telecommunications companies are either government owned
  or are heavily regulated, privately owned monopolies who comply with most government
  requests for backdoors or user data. The idea that today, we still need to give
  out our phone numbers as primary identifiers to be able to use the leading messaging
  apps should be frowned upon and actively challenged. It’s necessary to advocate
  for private alternatives in messaging that do not rely on user IDs of any kind -
  and yes, it’s possible.
