description: The Brave web browser has carved out a niche over the past few years
  as an alternative to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other mainstream web browsers.
  Some of that has come from its marketing as a privacy-preserving web browser, and
  it has also been repeatedly evangelized by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. If someone
  recommends Brave to you, you should ignore them, because they are wrong. Brave Browser
  is a mess of a software project, and the company building it is even worse.
