description: Imagine the situation when you’ve hovered over a menu item that reveals
  another list of menu items, then tried to hover over that nested menu only to have
  the entire menu close on you. Is this a UX challenge you’ve struggled with? A well-known
  concept called the “safe triangle” solves this issue. While it’s been tackled many
  ways over the years, Costa Alexoglou has what he believes is a relatively straightforward
  approach using SVG and tracking a user’s mouse position to prevent nested menus
  from inadvertently closing on a user.
