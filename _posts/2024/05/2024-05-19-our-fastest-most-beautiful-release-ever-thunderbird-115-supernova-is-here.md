description: On behalf of the Thunderbird team, Thunderbird Council, our global community
  of contributors, and our extended Mozilla family, I am incredibly excited to announce
  the initial launch of Thunderbird 115 “Supernova” for Linux, macOS, and Windows!
  With this year’s version, we’re delivering much more than just another yearly release.
  Supernova represents a modernized overhaul of the software – both visually and technically
  – while retaining the familiarity and flexibility you expect from Thunderbird.
