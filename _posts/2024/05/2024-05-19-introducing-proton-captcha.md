description: At Proton, we’re always working on new and innovative ways to protect
  the privacy and data of the Proton community. Sometimes that means developing entirely
  new services, like our Proton Sentinel program, which combines AI and human security
  analysts to increase the account security for high-profile users. Other times, it
  means taking an old idea and putting a new twist on it, like our new, custom-built
  CAPTCHA.
