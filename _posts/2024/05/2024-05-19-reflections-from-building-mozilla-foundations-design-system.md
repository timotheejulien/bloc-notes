description: "As our small *but mighty* design team grows and matures, the need for a design system kept coming up. And our website was growing and more things were being made! We switched from Sketch to Figma in 2020 and while we were able to import our old system, it was getting increasingly difficult to know what the most updated asset was. Our UI kit was incomplete, disconnected from code, and components were not built responsively or with editability in mind. A design system to us means having a source of truth for all of our design components alongside a collection of documented design decisions and processes. This year we were able to dedicate some time to building out our design system in Figma. We only had 3 months to build a solid foundation and here are our reflections at the end of it all."
