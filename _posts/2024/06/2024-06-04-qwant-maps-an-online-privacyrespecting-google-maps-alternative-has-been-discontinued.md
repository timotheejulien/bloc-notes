description: "Earlier this month, Qwant Maps, a free and privacy-respecting online map service built on OpenStreetMap by the creators of the Qwant search engine, was completely shut down. In a post on X, Qwant announced that following its acquisition by Synfonium, the Qwant Maps service was deactivated. Instead, a “maps module” has been integrated into the search function, though I was unable to access it when looking for places or addresses… Qwant stated that they are prioritizing enhancing the search experience with new features, while acknowledging that this decision may not be well-received by all users."
