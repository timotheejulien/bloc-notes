description: "For years, I viewed accessible design as a set of boring and restrictive rules. Text contrast ratios, focus states for buttons - these were things I thought made design worse, not better. I wasn't alone in this mindset. I've heard colleagues dismiss accessibility concerns, saying things like, « We're not going to have any blind users, so it's not going to be a problem.» Or designers insisting that light grey text is perfectly readable because they can see it with their poor eyesight. But lately, I've been trying to shift my mindset on accessibility. I've realized that accessible design isn't just about adhering to technical guidelines - it's about creating products that work for anyone, in any situation."
