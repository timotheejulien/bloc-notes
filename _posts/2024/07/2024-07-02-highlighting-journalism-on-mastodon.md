title: Highlighting journalism on mastodon

description: To reinforce and encourage mastodon as the go-to place for journalism,
  we’re launching a new feature today. You will notice that underneath some links
  shared on mastodon, the author byline can be clicked to open the author’s associated
  fediverse account, right in the app. This highlights writers and journalists that
  are active on the fediverse, and makes it easier than ever to follow them and keep
  up with their future work—potentially across different publications. Writers often
  work with different publishers over the span of their careers, but mastodon is the
  perfect platform to amass a loyal audience that you, as the author, truly own, and
  can take with you across the fediverse.
