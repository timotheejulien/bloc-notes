description: "Several European countries are betting on open-source software. In the United States, eh, not so much. In the latest news from across the Atlantic, Switzerland has taken a major step forward with its Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks (EMBAG). This groundbreaking legislation mandates releasing open-source software (OSS) of the Federal government.

This new law requires all public bodies to disclose the source code of software developed by or for them unless third-party rights or security concerns prevent it. This public money, public code approach aims to enhance government operations' transparency, security, and efficiency."
