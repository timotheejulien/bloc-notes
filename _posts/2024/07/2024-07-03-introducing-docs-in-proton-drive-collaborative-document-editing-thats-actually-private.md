description: Billions of people use online document editors like google Docs or microsoft
  365 to write reports, collaborate on projects, and keep track of meeting notes.
  But there is a growing concern about Big Tech platforms having access to your content,
  tracking you across the web, and collecting data to train privacy-invading AI models.Today
  we’re announcing a new end-to-end encrypted, collaborative document editor that
  puts your privacy first. Docs in proton Drive are built on the same privacy and
  security principles as all our services, starting with end-to-end encryption. Docs
  let you collaborate in real time, leave comments, add photos, and store your files
  securely. Best of all, it’s all private — even keystrokes and cursor movements are
  encrypted.
