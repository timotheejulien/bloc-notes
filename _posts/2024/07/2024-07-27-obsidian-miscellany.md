description: "I’ve switched up my note-taking app a few times over the years:

I enjoyed Evernote for a long time until the start of their slow, sad descent.
The pain of rescuing my Evernote data led me to Simplenote. It’s a lot more portable, but proved too barebones for my needs.
I moved from Simplenote to Bear, which was (and still is) delightful. But it’s Apple-only, and I really missed my notes on my gaming PC, Linux laptop, etc. (I held out hope that the promised web app would materialize, but decided to believe Shiny Frog when they say it’s still “a ways off.”)
Along the way, I also tried or considered Anytype, Apple Notes, Google Keep, Heynote, Joplin, Jotsy, Logseq, Microsoft OneNote, Muse, nb, TiddlyWiki, Tot, and probably a few others I’m forgetting.

But for the last year or so, I’ve settled on Obsidian."
