description: HTML isn’t only for people working in the tech field. It’s for anybody,
  the way documents are for anybody. HTML is just another type of document. A very
  special one—the one the web is built on. I’m Blake Watson. I’ve been building websites
  since the early 2000s. Though I work professionally in the field, I feel strongly
  that anyone should be able to make a website with HTML if they want. This book will
  teach you how to do just that. It doesn’t require any previous experience making
  websites or coding. I will cover everything you need to know to get started in an
  approachable and friendly way.Ready? Let’s do it!
