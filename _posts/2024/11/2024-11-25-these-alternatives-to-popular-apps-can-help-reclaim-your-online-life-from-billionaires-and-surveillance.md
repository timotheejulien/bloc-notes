description: There is immense power in being in control of your own data. As ownership
  and governance of apps and online services consolidate, it’s understandable if you
  want to consider your options when it comes to where you store your private data
  and records of your everyday activities. Fortunately, not every service out there
  is trying to monetize your personal data, and many offerings are just as good (if
  not often better) as their commercial or ad-supported rivals. Take a minute to think
  about what you’d want to leave behind. Big Tech giants that hoard your data? Subscription
  services? Invasive ad tracking? Government surveillance? Your needs and risks are
  unique to you, but hopefully a few of these recommendations help to hit the spot.
