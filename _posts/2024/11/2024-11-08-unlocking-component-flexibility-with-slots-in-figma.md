description: Material Design is excited to introduce Slot Components, a powerful technique
  that allows you to create flexible and dynamic layouts with ease in the Material
  3 Figma Design Kit. Slot components unlock local custom component nesting in Figma.
  With this added flexibility to make changes and edits to components, slot components
  remove the need to disconnect from the main Material Design Kit. Components can
  now remain linked to the main library to receive updates and improvements as you
  change them to suit your needs.
