description: At EFF we spend a lot of time thinking about Street Level Surveillance
  technologies—the technologies used by police and other authorities to spy on you
  while you are going about your everyday life—such as automated license plate readers,
  facial recognition, surveillance camera networks, and cell-site simulators (CSS).
  Rayhunter is a new open source tool we’ve created that runs off an affordable mobile
  hotspot that we hope empowers everyone, regardless of technical skill, to help search
  out CSS around the world.
