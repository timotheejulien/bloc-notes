description: "We’re introducing a Terms of Use for Firefox for the first time, along with an updated Privacy Notice. Why now? Although we’ve historically relied on our open source license for Firefox and public commitments to you, we are building in a much different technology landscape today. We want to make these commitments abundantly clear and accessible."
