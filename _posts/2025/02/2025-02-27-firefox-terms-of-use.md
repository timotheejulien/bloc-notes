description: We’re introducing a Terms of Use for Firefox for the first time, along
  with an updated Privacy Notice. Why now? Although we’ve historically relied on our
  open source license for Firefox and public commitments to you, we are building in
  a much different technology landscape today. We want to make these commitments abundantly
  clear and accessible.
