description: Chinese app design looks weird. But, they work just as well as other
  apps and websites around the world. Why is that? I mean, it's cluttered, overwhelming
  for the eyes, and kinda just throws a bunch of things at you. Turns out, beneath
  the incredibly cluttered user interface lies undeniable psychology. In this video,
  I cover why this « cluttered and weird » design is necessary, how physical space
  correlates with Chinese software design, why Chinese users might prefer mobile over
  desktop altogether, and how all of this impacts us.
