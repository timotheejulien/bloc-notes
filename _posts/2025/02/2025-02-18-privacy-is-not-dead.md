description: In my work as a privacy advocate, I regularly encounter two types of
  discourse that I find very damaging to privacy as a whole. The first one is the
  idea that privacy is dead, implying it's not worth putting any effort to protect
  personal data anymore. This is the abdication mindset. This attitude is the one
  that scares me the most because without giving it a fight then of course the battle
  is lost in advance. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, privacy is dead if you let
  it die.
