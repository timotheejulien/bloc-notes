description: 'In the ever-changing world of product management, two key roles stand
  out in terms of their approach and specific objectives: the traditional Product
  Manager (PM) and the Growth Product Manager (GPM). Although their titles may seem
  similar, their responsibilities, methodologies and priorities differ considerably.
  This article explores these essential distinctions to better understand how each
  of these roles contributes to a product’s success. We will also look at the essential
  role played by the Growth Product Manager (GPM) in product evolution, through his
  or her focus on growth and ability to conduct structured experimentation. We will
  look at key concepts such as A/B testing and feature management (or feature flag)
  to illustrate this contribution.'
