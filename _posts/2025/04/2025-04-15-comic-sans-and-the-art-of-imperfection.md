description: "Comic Sans is the font that refuses to die. It’s been dragged, mocked, and meme-ified since the moment it became a household name. It’s been labeled childish, lazy, and unprofessional. Designers love to hate it. And yet, here we are, decades later, still talking about it. Comic Sans is still showing up in emails, on signs, in classrooms, and in protest posters. It’s survived countless waves of design trends and the court of public opinion. In a world obsessed with perfection, Comic Sans seems untouchable. Why? Because it’s fun. Because it’s flawed. Because it’s human."
