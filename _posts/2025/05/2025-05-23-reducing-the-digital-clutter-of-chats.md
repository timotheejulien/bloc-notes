description: "I hate modern chats. They presuppose we are always online, always available to chat. They force us to see and think about them each time we get our eyes on one of our devices. Unlike mailboxes, they are never empty. We canâ€™t even easily search through old messages (unlike the chat providers themselves, which use the logs to learn more about us). Chats are the epitome of the business idiot: they make you always busy but prevent you from thinking and achieving anything."
