description: "The use of access technology often compromises privacy for disabled individuals. Detecting such technology can reveal personal health information, limit access to services, and result in data being sold to third parties. Text-only versions of websites and apps that require personal information for functionality are inadequate solutions. Advocacy is needed to protect the privacy rights of disabled people while ensuring equal access to technology and services."
